# EncryptionDecryption
A program to encrypt and decrypt a plain text file in C

NOTE: Written on Linux

To compile the code, use the makefile by typing "make" in the directory.

You can encrypt the data in a file (with any filetype ending) by typing 'encDec -i [input file] -o [output file] -k [encryption key]'
The output file does not need to exist, it will be made when the program is successfully run.
For example, I pass through the file 'input.dec'
