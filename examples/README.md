The ```.dec``` file (meaning decrypted file) is the original file.
Using the command ```encDec -i jameTime.dec -o jameTime[Alpha/Bravo/Charlie].enc -k key.[alpha/bravo.charlie]``` we can get a .enc file (meaning encrypted file).

The ```.enc``` files can be decrypted back to clear text using the command ```encDec -i jameTime[Alpha/Bravo/Charlie].enc -o jameTime[Alpha/Bravo/Charlie]Decrypted -k key.[alpha/bravo/charlie]```, making sure we
use the same key we used to encrypt the file.

If the wrong key is used to decrypt a file, then it will become more encrypted and not become clear text.
